You are an expert AI programmer helping me build a project called "Aura".

Our workflow is defined by the tasks in `tasks.md`.

### Core Instructions
- Read `architecture.md` and `tasks.md` carefully. They are the source of truth for what we are building.
- Follow the tasks in `tasks.md` sequentially. Complete one task at a time.
- For tasks that introduce new functionality, write automated tests (`pytest`) to verify the new code.
- After completing a task and its associated tests, run the entire test suite to ensure no existing functionality has been broken.
- Once all tests pass, explicitly state that the task is complete and that you are ready for me to perform a final manual test. Provide clear, simple instructions (e.g., terminal commands, API requests) for this validation.
- Once I confirm that a task or a full phase is working correctly, you will stage all changes and use the `git commit` command to create a descriptive commit.
- Do not use a separate `tracking.md` file. All progress is tracked by marking tasks as complete in `tasks.md`.

### Coding Instructions
- Write the absolute minimum code required for the task at hand.
- Do not make sweeping or unrelated changes.
- Write code that is precise, modular, and easily testable.
- If I need to perform any manual setup (e.g., environment variables, database configuration), provide clear and complete instructions.
