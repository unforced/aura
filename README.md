# Project Aura

Welcome to Project Aura, an intelligent grant writing assistant powered by AI.

## Overview

Aura aims to streamline the grant writing process by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. It allows users to upload source documents (e.g., research papers, project plans) and then ask questions or generate grant proposal sections based on that information.

This repository contains all components of the project, including:

-   `aura-backend/`: A FastAPI backend that handles user authentication, document processing, and the core AI logic.
-   `architecture.md`: A high-level overview of the system architecture.
-   `tasks.md`: The detailed, step-by-step plan for building the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, please refer to the `README.md` file within the `aura-backend` directory for specific setup and execution instructions.
